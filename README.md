A shot chart comparison demonstrating the difference between Curry's and Kyrie's shooting positions on the court and their accuracy with respect to these positions.

Region: The United States of America (NBA)
Domain: Sports

I made my own datasets with information from the following because the stats.nba.com stopped sharing their shot chart information through their private API's:
Steph's Basketball Reference Shooting page: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01/shooting/2019
Kyrie's Basketball Reference Shooting page: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01/shooting/2019

Find the datasets in the form of .txt files below:
